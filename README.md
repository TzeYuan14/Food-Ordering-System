# Food-Ordering-System

We live in challenging yet interesting times. With COVID-19, social distancing becoming a solid norm 
and eating in a crowded restaurant is no longer possible. However, we can still enjoy the delicious food 
from the restaurants by having Food Ordering system. 
To maintain business, restaurant needs this system to showcase their menu by keeping track the prices, 
delivery time, number of orders by customers and sales for each item in the menu. The manager will be
able to view the total sales, the most popular dish in the menu and number of customers for the day.
The pandemic will turn you the system developer into warriors of the modern world.
